Disclaimer
==========

We provide adjusted packages of Kolab for use by TBits.net.

We recommend to use the official packages from Kolab Systems!

Differences
===========

We applied the patches available at https://github.com/tbits/kolabscripts

We drop guam, because we have patched Cyrus to show the same behaviour, hiding Kolab specific folders from other clients.

We drop amavis and clamav, because we have a separate server for filtering Spam at TBits.net.
